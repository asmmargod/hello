        <h2>Hello there!</h2>
        <p>My name is Marcin and I'm interested in making websites looking pretty. I also learn to code so I get to know how to make the websites I create pretty, cool and functional. I am also a fellow human being interested in getting to know other
          fellow human beings. Come and say <span style="text-shadow: 1px 1px 3px #002B5B">"Hi"!</span></p>

        <h3>Web Design</h3>
        <p>I got introduced to web designing when I started volunteering for an organization in 2021. I know, quite late in my life, but better late than never! Initailly I was making webpages usign a builder called divi, then I also started using
          different plugins till eventually I decided to learn how to code so here I am, coding my first website.</p>

        <img class="content" src="images/content.png" alt="content">
        <h3>Content Creation</h3>
        <p>I love creating fresh content that comes out of my head. I also like researching already exsiting content and mixing it all up to create something unique. I think I've got a good eye for finding just the right stuff that is already there.
          Sometimes there's no need to reinvent the wheel unless a square or rectangle is needed. See what I did there?</p>

        <img class="music" src="images/music.png" alt="code">
        <h3>Music</h3>
        <p>Music plays an important role in my life. Unfortunately I can't write music or play an instrument although at some point I started to learn how to play a guitar. Anyway, you might want to know that when I will be designing a beautiful
          website for you I will be listening to a ton of music and it will help me to make your webiste as beautiful as possibble.</p>
